## Portfolio Projects

The following are my data analytics projects, which showcases my skillset and briefly describes the technology used in each case.

**Description:** This project is my analysis of the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certicate** capstone task. I will be analyzing the user pattern of the membership types of Cyclistic, a bike share company in Chicago. Cyclistic's bike-share program features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who canâ€™t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.

**Technology:** `R Programming language`, `tidyverse`, `skimr`, `nania`, `ggplot2` and `PowerBI`
