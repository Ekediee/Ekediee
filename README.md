## Portfolio Projects

The following are my data analytics projects, which showcases my skillset and briefly describes the technology used in each case.

### Consoto Sales' Analysis

**Description:** In this project, I analysed the sales, profits and refund records of Microsoft's Consoto Dataset, comprising of transaction records from branches of the organization across three continents (Asia, Europe, and Nort America), with a total of 306 stores covering 4 channels (Online, store, catalog, and reseller) with three years of data (2014 to 2016), making a total of 2.28 million transactions.

I developed a dynamic dashboard using `Streamlit` and `Plotly`, to help business managers monitor transactions on the fly, [click here]() to view the dashboard. The analysis was aimed at providing insight to help top excutives make data driven business decisions for organizational growth.

The TL;DR breakdown of the analysis can be accessed [here]()\
**Technology Used:** `SQL`, `DuckDB`, `Python`, `Plotly`, and `Streamlit`

### Divvy Bike Analysis

**Repo:** [README.md](https://github.com/Ekediee/divvy-bike-analysis#readme)\
**Visualization:** [Dashboard](https://divvy-trips.streamlit.app)\
**Description:** This project is my analysis of the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certicate** capstone task. I analyzed the user pattern of the membership types of 𝗟𝘆𝗳𝘁 𝗕𝗶𝗸𝗲𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗦𝗰𝗼𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀, a bike share company in Chicago. Lyft bike-share program features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Lyft sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Lyft users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.

**Technology:** `Python Programming language`, `Plotly`, `Streamlit`, `SQLite`, `Pandas`
