## Portfolio Projects

The following are my data analytics projects, which showcases my skillset and briefly describes the technology used in each case.

### Consoto Sales' Analysis

**Description:** In this project, I analysed the sales, profits and refund records of Microsoft's Consoto Dataset, comprising of transaction records from branches of the organization across three continents (Asia, Europe, and Nort America), with a total of 306 stores covering 4 channels (Online, store, catalog, and reseller) with three years of data (2014 to 2016), making a total of 2.28 million transactions.

I developed a dynamic dashboard using `Streamlit` and `Plotly`, to help business managers monitor transactions on the fly, [click here]() to view the dashboard. The analysis was aimed at providing insight to help top excutives make data driven business decisions for organizational growth.

The TL;DR breakdown of the analysis can be accessed [here]()\
**Technology Used:** `SQL`, `DuckDB`, `Python`, `Plotly`, and `Streamlit`

### Divvy Bike Share User Analysis

**Repo:** [README.md](https://github.com/Ekediee/Divvy-Bike-Share-User-Analysis#readme)\
**Code:** [index.Rmd](https://ekediee.github.io/Divvy-Bike-Share-User-Analysis/)\
**Presentation:** [Slides.pptx](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ca6tiM3zHOok0BsCj6UXEulj-x2g2BiGmJmq7UkFrAU/edit?usp=sharing) - access dynamic viz -> [Dashboard](https://www.novypro.com/project/bike-share-user-analysis-by-ekeoma-agu)\
**Description:** This project is my analysis of the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certicate** capstone task. I analyzed the user pattern of the membership types of Cyclistic, a bike share company in Chicago. Cyclistic's bike-share program features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who canâ€™t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.

**Technology:** `R Programming language`, `tidyverse`, `skimr`, `nania`, `ggplot2` and `PowerBI`
